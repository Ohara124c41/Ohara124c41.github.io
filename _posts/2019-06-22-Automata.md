> **Purpose.** These notes are my own write-up of the lecture material from the course *Automata, Language Theory, and Complexity*. I adapted the technical content into a blog-friendly format while preserving the formal detail, worked examples, and connections to broader computational theory. All images and examples are reconstructed based on my understanding of the use cases.

## 1. Introduction

Automata theory forms the foundation of computer science. It begins with **finite automata** for regular languages, extends to **context-free grammars** and **pushdown automata**, and culminates with **Turing machines** and the limits of computation. Finally, complexity theory introduces classes such as P and NP and the notion of NP-completeness.

## 2. Finite Automata and Regular Languages

### 2.1 Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

**Definition.**  
A DFA is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where  
- $Q$: finite set of states,  
- $\Sigma$: alphabet,  
- $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q$: transition function,  
- $q_0$: start state,  
- $F$: accepting states.

### 2.2 Worked Example: DFA for divisibility by 3

**Problem.** Build a DFA over $\{0,1\}$ that accepts binary strings whose value is divisible by 3.  

**Solution.**  
- States $q_0, q_1, q_2$ represent remainder mod 3.  
- Start $q_0$, accepting $q_0$.  
- Transition: on input $b$, new state = $(2 \cdot r + b) \bmod 3$.  

So “110” = 6, ends in $q_0$, accepted.

## 3. Regular Expressions and Properties

### 3.1 Equivalence of Regular Expressions and Automata

Every regex corresponds to an NFA; NFAs and DFAs are equivalent.

### 3.2 Pumping Lemma

**Lemma.**  
If $L$ is regular, $\exists p$ such that for $w \in L$ with $|w|\geq p$, $w=xyz$, $|xy|\leq p$, $|y|\geq1$, and $xy^iz \in L$ $\forall i \geq 0$.

### Worked Example: Non-regularity

**Problem.** Show $L=\{a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0\}$ is not regular.  

**Solution.**  
- Assume $L$ is regular, pumping length $p$.  
- Choose $w=a^p b^p$.  
- $y$ lies in $a$’s; pumping $y$ changes # of $a$’s.  
- Resulting string has more $a$’s than $b$’s, not in $L$. Contradiction.

## 4. Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)

### 4.1 Definition

A CFG is $(V, \Sigma, R, S)$ with variables $V$, terminals $\Sigma$, rules $R$, and start $S$.

### 4.2 Worked Example: Balanced Parentheses

**Grammar.** $S \to SS \mid (S) \mid \epsilon$  

**Example derivation.** $(()())$:  
$S \Rightarrow (S) \Rightarrow (SS) \Rightarrow (S(S)) \Rightarrow (()())$.

### 4.3 Ambiguity Example

Grammar $E \to E+E \mid E*E \mid a$.  
The string $a+a*a$ has two parse trees, showing ambiguity.

---

## 5. Pushdown Automata (PDA)

### 5.1 Definition

PDA = $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, Z_0, F)$ with stack alphabet $\Gamma$.

### 5.2 Worked Example: PDA for $\{a^n b^n\}$

- On $a$: push $A$.  
- On $b$: pop $A$.  
- Accept if stack empty at end.  

Trace on “aaabbb”: stack pushes 3 $A$, then pops 3, accept.

---

## 6. Advanced Context-Free Language Properties

- **Normal forms:** CNF, GNF.  
- **Pumping lemma for CFLs.**  

### Worked Example: Not Context-Free

$L=\{a^n b^n c^n \mid n\geq0\}$.  
Suppose pumping length $p$. Take $w=a^p b^p c^p$.  
By lemma, pumped substring affects at most 2 of the 3 segments.  
Resulting string unbalanced → contradiction.  

So $L$ not context-free.

## 7. Turing Machines and Computability

### 7.1 Definition

TM = $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{\text{accept}}, q_{\text{reject}})$.  

### 7.2 Worked Example: Palindrome TM

Algorithm:  
1. Mark first symbol, scan right to last symbol.  
2. Compare, erase both.  
3. Repeat.  
4. Accept if string fully erased.

---

## 8. Decidability and Undecidability

### 8.1 Halting Problem

Given TM $M$ and input $w$, no decider exists for “does $M$ halt on $w$?” Proof by diagonalization.

### 8.2 Worked Example: Reduction

Show CFG intersection emptiness undecidable.  
Reduce from halting problem: encode TM into CFGs $G_1, G_2$ such that $L(G_1)\cap L(G_2)\neq \emptyset$ iff TM halts.  

---

## 9. Complexity Theory

### 9.1 P and NP

$P$: languages decidable in polynomial time.  
$NP$: languages verifiable in polynomial time.

### 9.2 NP-Completeness

$L$ is NP-complete if $L\in NP$ and every $L'\in NP$ polytime reduces to $L$.

### Worked Example: Reduction 3SAT → Independent Set

- Clause with 3 literals → 3 vertices forming triangle.  
- Connect contradictory literals.  
- Graph has independent set of size = #clauses iff formula satisfiable.  

Thus Independent Set is NP-complete.

- PSPACE, PSPACE-completeness.  
- Randomized complexity (RP, BPP).  
- Connections to verification/model checking.
