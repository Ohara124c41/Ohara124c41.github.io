> **Purpose.** Rewrite of my full investigation notes (originally compiled as a graduate diploma final report) into a blog-friendly format. I preserved the technical detail: paper summaries, images, convergent/divergent themes, and how I applied these ideas in my (now completed) PhD research. References are included at the end. All images were created based on my understanding of the use cases.

## Introduction

The goal of this study was to **explore and synthesize resilience engineering** across seven key papers, then relate those findings to the principles and implementations I used during my PhD work on adaptive robotic systems. In engineering terms, resilience is the system’s **ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from disruptions** while preserving mission value.

I examined methods spanning **multi-agent systems**, **swarm intelligence**, and **resilience-driven design frameworks**. For each paper, I produced a concise summary and a **high-level diagram** to communicate its core concept and workflow. I then mapped **shared strategies** (self-organization, self-healing, adaptive decision-making) and contrasted **divergent emphases** (formal guarantees vs. heuristic autonomy; space/robotics vs. infrastructure/catastrophe management).

In my PhD research (past tense), I **implemented** adaptive sensor fusion, dynamic reinforcement learning, and health-management-informed control to increase resilience in dynamic, hazardous environments. The objective was consistent with the literature: **maintain acceptable function under surprise** and **recover quickly**.

## Paper 1 — *Engineering Resilient Collective Adaptive Systems by Self-Stabilisation*

This work introduces **field calculus** and a **self-stabilizing fragment** that guarantees eventual convergence under transient perturbations. Local, asynchronous device rounds compose primitives for **propagation, aggregation, and time evolution**; choosing the right building blocks yields **network-level resilience** even as topology or state shifts.

Key ideas:
- Design with **provably self-stabilizing blocks**; swap implementations for performance without losing guarantees.  
- Validate by combining formal reasoning with empirical simulation.  
- Applicable in IoT, sensor networks, and smart city scenarios.

## Paper 2 — *Resilience-Driven System Design (RDSD) of Complex Engineered Systems*

RDSD elevates resilience to a **top-level allocation problem** and couples it to **RBDO** (reliability-based design optimization) and **PHM** (prognostics & health management). Instead of paying for brute redundancy, allocate **reliability, redundancy, and PHM effort** where each delivers the best lifecycle value.

Key ideas:
- **RAP (Resilience Allocation Problem):** define resilience as a function of reliability and PHM efficiency.  
- Use case (aircraft actuator): optimized mix of reliability, PHM, and redundancy → **fewer costs, higher adaptive reliability**.

## Paper 3 — *Engineering Resilience Quantification & Design Implications (Survey)*

Three families of metrics organize how we quantify resilience:

1. **Resilience curve metrics:** area-under-loss over time (integrates degradation depth and recovery speed).  
2. **Pre/post ratios:** steady-state performance comparison.  
3. **Reliability × Restoration:** joint probability and time-to-restore blend.

Design implications:
- Prefer **curve-based metrics** when dynamics matter (most real systems).  
- Use predictive analysis to assess design alternatives.  
- Watch for interdependencies and emergent behaviors; standardization is still evolving.

## Paper 4 — *Resilient Control Systems: A Multi-Agent Dynamic Systems Perspective*

A layered **HMADS** (management → coordination → execution) enables **distributed decision-making** that sustains state awareness/function under cyber-physical disturbances. Consensus/contract-net/fuzzy/Bayesian methods help agents **reallocate**, **reconfigure**, and **continue operations** with partial failures or latency.

Key ideas:
- **Decentralize** to avoid single points of failure.  
- Combine **computational intelligence** with MAS to adapt policy under uncertainty.

## Paper 5 — *Integrating Risk and Resilience for Catastrophe Management*

Risk minimizes probability for **known** hazards; resilience minimizes **consequence** for **unknowns**. The recommended operational loop is **monitor → anticipate → adapt → learn**. Case work (Mississippi River Basin flooding) demonstrates adaptive infrastructure and decision-making over rigid, probability-only approaches.

Key ideas:
- Favor **diversity, graceful degradation, cohesion, regrowth** over oversizing.  
- Resilience is **dynamic and process-oriented**, not just a static attribute.

## Paper 6 — *Resilience Engineering: Theory & Practice in Interdependent Infrastructure*

Interdependent networks (power, water, transport) can cascade. Practical resilience blends **performance-based engineering**, **adaptive capacity**, **scenario analysis**, and **graph-based interdependency modeling** to plan **recovery pathways** and prevent systemic collapse.

Key ideas:
- Integrate resilience into **standard design practice**, not as an afterthought.  
- Interdisciplinary methods and shared frameworks are required to avoid siloed failure modes.

## Paper 7 — *Swarm Technology at NASA: Building Resilient Systems*

Swarm systems (e.g., ANTS concepts) leverage **self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, and self-protection** to accomplish missions with minimal ground control. Local rules produce **global robustness**: the swarm re-organizes around loss and keeps producing mission value.

Key ideas:
- Autonomy and **collective adaptation** over centralized micromanagement.  
- Extends beyond space: defense, underwater, medical micro-robotics.

## Similar Themes & Related Concepts

- **Distributed decision-making** (MAS, swarms) reduces fragility.  
- **PHM + condition-based control** turns faults into **graceful degradation**, not mission aborts.  
- **Self-stabilizing/contractive update rules** enable predictable convergence.  
- **Curve-based metrics** track recovery dynamics, not just time-between-failures.  
- **Continuous resilience management:** monitor, anticipate, adapt, learn—**as an operational habit**.

## Divergent Themes & Design Levers

- **Quantification:** curve area vs. ratios vs. reliability×restoration.  
- **Domain:** spacecraft/industrial control vs. civil infrastructure/catastrophe response.  
- **Optimization target:** lifecycle cost vs. mission success vs. recovery time.  
- **Formality:** proof-carrying components vs. heuristic autonomy and learning.

## Relation to My PhD Thesis (now completed)

During my PhD, I focused on **resilience for robotic systems** in dynamic, hazardous environments:

- **ISS & lab robots (sensor management / fusion):** I implemented an **awareness-driven, adaptive sensor toggling and fusion** pipeline to balance information quality with compute/energy. PHM informed **fault detection** and **fallback modes**.
- **Industrial navigation (graph + multi-objective RL):** I used a dynamic multi-reward PPO approach (DynaMRPPO) combining **hazard avoidance, efficiency, and information gain** so robots learned **risk-aware paths** under change.

Architectural patterns I used:
- **Decentralized sharing** (vectorized agents, **shared replay buffer**, mediator role) to improve sample efficiency and robustness.  
- **Formal-leaning guardrails** (HMMs for latent modes, Monte Carlo stress tests) to evaluate recovery and avoid brittle behaviors.  
- **Resilience metrics** (curve area, time-to-restore, mission work-not-done) rather than simple success rates.

The parametric diagram below captures the **qualitative trade-offs** I managed: energy ↔ compute ↔ information value ↔ safety margins ↔ recovery time.

### PhD Thesis Summary (concise)

- **Objective:** adaptive robotic systems making context-aware decisions in dynamic environments (ISS & hazardous plants).
- **Techniques:** sensor management & fusion, meta-learning, graph-based planning, dynamic multi-reward RL.  
- **Resilience application:** anticipate → monitor → respond → learn; manage compute/energy budgets; design **degraded modes**.  
- **Evaluation:** injected disturbances, hidden-mode shifts (HMM), recovery curves, and mission-level outcomes.

## Future Work

- **Scalable MAS architectures:** reduce coordination overhead as agents scale.  
- **Real-time pipelines:** ensure sensing → prediction → action is **deadline-aware**.  
- **Human–machine teaming:** supervisory control and **explainable degraded modes**.  
- **Resource stewardship:** explicit energy/compute budgets and **resilience audits** per release.  
- **High-consequence domains:** e.g., post-disaster inspection or space ops—**practice recovery**, don’t just model it.
