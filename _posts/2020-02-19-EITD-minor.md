> Purpose: This post explains how the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Minor in the EIT Digital Master School shaped my path as a system architect. Through three projects between 2018 and 2019 I learned how to pivot vision into MVP, align innovation with civic stakeholders, and turn a technical prototype into a product. Two of these projects became real companies and all three taught me lessons in connecting engineering with business and society.

## Introduction
The EIT Digital Master School integrates a technical major with a full minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. This minor is not a side course but a structured path of projects that challenge students to act like entrepreneurs.  

I entered via the IoT through Embedded Systems track as one of two selected worldwide. Over eighteen months the I and E minor took me through three projects in sequence  

1. LABELEDBY. (January to July 2018)  
2. Rennes Summer School (August 2018)  
3. Smart FC (October 2018 to March 2019)  

Two of those projects LABELEDBY. and Smart FC eventually became real companies. This blog tells how each stage unfolded what I learned and why this experience shaped me as a system architect.

## 1 LABELEDBY. From Vision to MVP (January to July 2018)

The Innovation Space Project at TUe was my first opportunity in the I and E minor. Our goal was to conceive a high impact venture rooted in technology and sustainability.  

### The Idea and the Pivot
We began imagining smart garment factories that would automate production reduce waste and bring manufacturing back to local communities. The vision was bold but the challenge immense. As we talked to users and examined cost structures we realized the scale was unrealistic in our timeframe. The decision was made to pivot. Instead of factories we would focus on a single product **customizable sustainable clutches**.  

### Hardships and Challenges
Team dynamics were tough. Engineers designers and business students spoke different languages. At times I felt we were drifting without alignment. Pivoting the project meant letting go of our original dream which was psychologically difficult.  

Crafting a viable product taught me that materials matter. Early prototypes failed in durability aesthetics and cost. Some combinations of leather fabrics 3D printed elements and finishes just did not work. We iterated many small prototypes and tested user acceptance.  

Market skepticism was another barrier. The fashion space is crowded. We needed a narrative. We recruited ambassadors and influencers using their voice to elevate the product beyond aesthetics. Their feedback was blunt and useful.  

### Breakthrough and Outcome
Our market research showed a total addressable market of about 7.25 million women in the Netherlands. We carved out a serviceable obtainable market of about 220000 buyers in the mid high income bracket who valued sustainability and customization. Price as a clutch around 80 euros struck the balance between value and margin.  

Over time LABELEDBY. became more than a class project. It attracted attention customer interest and progressed toward becoming a sustainable fashion tech startup active today. For me the lesson was clear a project that pivots intelligently is more viable than a perfect yet impractical vision.

## 2 Rennes Summer School Platforms for Smart Cities (August 2018)

Next I joined the EIT Digital Summer School in Rennes. The focus was digital platforms for smart cities. Unlike LABELEDBY. this project was not about a tangible product but designing innovation in a civic ecosystem.  

### The Experience
My team was multinational and multidisciplinary. We had to work quickly to propose a platform for urban mobility that integrated IoT data analytics and municipal systems. We balanced technical design with user need and city constraints.  

### Hardships and Constraints
Cities operate under policy governance and regulation. Every idea faced questions about privacy data sharing infrastructure compatibility and standards. Our technical proposals often clashed with municipal realities.  

Team communication was another friction point. Sometimes engineers would push features that business or design team deemed unfeasible. We had to learn to converge on shared language and purpose.  

Time pressure was real. We had two weeks only to ideate prototype validate and pitch to a jury of industry and municipal stakeholders. We worked late nights rewriting models rethinking trajectories and aligning with public authorities.  

### Breakthrough and Learning
We shifted our framing. Instead of trying to solve mobility directly we proposed a **platform orchestration model** modular layers for crowdsourced data integration service APIs and incremental adoption. This allowed cities to adopt parts without replacing existing systems wholesale.  

What stood out was that innovation in civic context demands not just tech but **negotiation compromise stakeholder alignment**. The project was never meant to launch a company. Its value lay in teaching that architecture must consider governance law public interest and technical feasibility in tandem.

## 3 Smart FC From Prototype to Productization (October 2018 to March 2019)

The final phase of the minor was the thesis project. I focused on drones and flight control. The problem was clear tuning flight controllers across varied UAV platforms is laborious error prone and inconsistent.  

### The Concept
I designed Smart FC an environment allowing automated tuning real time response visualization validation workflows and integrations with existing toolchains. The vision was to lower entry barrier for UAV developers and labs.  

### Hardships and Technical Tradeoffs
We debated whether to build a desktop tool or a cloud platform. Desktop had latency IP control offline potential. Cloud had collaboration scalability but risk to proprietary code. Each path demanded compromise.  

Intellectual property risk was real. Many UAV and control libraries are open source under restrictive licenses. We designed the architecture to modularize proprietary modules so we could avoid copyleft license contamination.  

Designing the UI was more than aesthetics. Our research showed that too many layers or features discourage engineers. A shallow interface with one click autotuning and visual feedback was more adoptable.  

Pricing and licensing were hard questions. Should we use a one time license subscription or modular toolbox model We benchmarked MathWorks toolbox open source models and subscription models to find a balance.  

Customer discovery was difficult. Larger drone firms were entrenched in existing toolchains. Smaller labs had limited budgets. Outreach and repeated pitches became necessary to find early adopters.  

### Breakthrough and Outcome
The project was successful enough that Smart FC moved beyond a thesis into a standalone company. The path from concept to startup taught me that **productization is as architectural as algorithm development**.  

Designing systems that real engineers adopt requires decisions about UI licensing IP performance tradeoffs and market positioning. That is the core of systems architecture in practice.

## Integration and Reflection

These three projects form a learning arc. LABELEDBY. taught me how to pivot validate and launch a product in a saturated market. The Rennes summer school taught me stakeholder management civic constraints and cross functional alignment. Smart FC taught me how to turn research into a product with sustainable business structure.  

As a system architect I do more than design modules and interfaces. I design systems within contexts regulatory business human societal. The I and E minor taught me that architecture must factor in ecosystems markets and value.

## Conclusion and Future

The EIT Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship minor was not a side path. It was the crucible in which technology business and society converged in practice.  

Two projects LABELEDBY. and Smart FC became companies. One was a civic innovation platform. Each stage challenged me in new ways.  

For engineers and architects reading this the lesson is that **building systems is only half the task**. You must build the environment in which systems succeed. The I and E minor gave me the tools the humility and the perspective to do that.

## Additional Interview
As I pursued my Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PdEng) and grew into leadership and systems design roles I remained committed to integrating technical depth and entrepreneurship.
