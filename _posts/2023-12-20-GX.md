The SPRING-GX and WING-CFS programs at the University of Tokyo are designed to produce researchers capable of bridging science, engineering, policy, and medicine. My participation connected directly to projects in digital transformation (DX) and green transformation (GX), where the focus was on reducing energy consumption, designing resilient systems, and linking academic outputs to real societal problems.

---

When we speak about GX in Japan, the discourse often reduces to policy slogans or sector-level targets. In practice, GX is achieved through fine-grained engineering: lowering computational loads, optimizing energy decisions, and embedding efficient behaviors into the systems we design. My posters for WING-CFS emphasized that my research was contributing to GX by reducing energy consumption through adaptive sensor management and reinforcement learning.

SPRING-GX emphasizes interdisciplinarity. It is not enough to build algorithms or hardware in isolation. The program deliberately brings together engineering researchers with peers in medicine, social sciences, and policy. The rationale is clear: energy transition and digital transformation are not only technical problems but socio-technical ones, requiring collaboration across silos. My own projects were strengthened by this framing, situating engineering in the broader societal ecosystem.

---

Through this program, I was introduced to System JD, a Japanese company specializing in energy-saving and clean-energy solutions. They provided the industrial theme for our Project Based Learning (PBL) exercise under the course *Engineering Competency I*. The challenge was to validate the Japanese 6th Basic Energy Plan in the context of Tsushima Island, a border island facing demographic decline, rising energy costs, and ecological pressures.

---

The Tsushima project was framed as “verification” of energy policy in practice. Tsushima relies on fossil fuels for about 90% of its energy, with limited deployment of rooftop solar. The population has shrunk from 70,000 in 1960 to less than 30,000 today. Costs per capita for energy are rising. At the same time, the island suffers from sea debris, declining agriculture, and pressure on marine ecosystems. These conditions created a perfect testbed for GX policies.

---

Our team proposed a “floating island” concept: modular solar arrays installed offshore, designed to withstand typhoons, adapt to sea level, and integrate with existing aquaculture facilities. The proposal was not purely technical. It incorporated stakeholder negotiations with fishermen, consideration of natural disasters, and strategies for recycling marine debris into biomass energy.

We visited Tsushima in December 2021. At the city hall we discussed concerns such as fishery impacts, storage technology, and disaster resilience. At CAPPA we observed ocean debris firsthand and saw how awareness and tourism could be linked to recycling initiatives. At Digital Hollywood we compared our floating concept with international examples, such as Singapore’s large-scale floating solar farms. These site visits grounded our proposal in lived reality.

---

The visit also highlighted cultural and historical layers. Tsushima is not only an energy problem but a site of national heritage and border security. Any technical plan had to respect the pride and traditions of the local population. The “biomass island” framing was therefore not simply about kWh, but about embedding renewable energy into Tsushima’s cultural and ecological fabric.

---

Our quantitative validation compared the costs of solar deployment with existing fossil fuel expenditures. While initial investment was high, the long-term return on investment favored renewables. More importantly, the floating island concept provided resilience benefits: stable supply in emergencies, adaptation to extreme weather, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in line with Japan’s 2030 and 2050 targets. This fit directly into the S+3E framework (Safety, Energy Security, Economic Efficiency, Environment).

---

We developed policy proposals alongside the technical design. These included strengthening accountability structures, generating local capacity through youth involvement, promoting community outreach, and pushing for energy market liberalization. The dual track of technical and policy outputs mirrored the interdisciplinary design of SPRING-GX itself. We also aligned with relevant SDGs (a very Japanese thing to do...).

The project gained visibility beyond academia. Our “floating island” concept was presented at Tsushima City Hall and later featured on local television.  

**Presentation moment:**

This outreach was important: not only did it communicate ideas, it also demonstrated that university research can engage local governments and communities. The project was recognized as a small but concrete step toward linking GX ambitions with real-world constraints.

---

At the same time, my personal research under WING-CFS connected resilience engineering with energy efficiency. My posters emphasized agent-driven sensor switching heuristics, where robots dynamically minimize energy use while preserving safety and performance.  

**Second poster example:**

The framing tied directly into GX goals: efficiency is not abstract, it is a measurable reduction in CPU load, energy draw, and resource usage in dynamic environments.

---

SPRING-GX and WING-CFS both emphasize that modern researchers must span disciplinary boundaries. The projects are not siloed: one week you may be talking to policymakers, another week presenting to engineers, another week analyzing ecological data. For me, the Tsushima project showed how engineering tools can be embedded in policy contexts, while my robotics work demonstrated how energy-aware algorithms support GX.

---

One strength of the programs is their emphasis on Project Based Learning. The Tsushima work was not a simulation in a classroom but a multi-stakeholder project with real site visits, city officials, and company facilitators. This gave the work urgency and reality: when you propose a floating island concept in front of the mayor, you realize that GX is not just policy rhetoric, it is community livelihood.

---

The link between DX and GX was also highlighted. Digital technologies such as sensor networks, monitoring systems, and simulation frameworks are not ends in themselves. They exist to enable greener, more efficient, and more resilient infrastructures. My own research sits directly at this nexus, using digital tools to deliver energy-aware robotic decision-making.

---

The Tsushima project also reinforced the idea that energy transition is not only technical but demographic. With population decline, energy costs rise per capita. A resilient solution must therefore integrate renewable generation with socio-economic revitalization. Our proposals included linking floating solar to tourism, education, and youth involvement. In this way, GX is not only about carbon, but about sustaining communities.

---

Looking back, the SPRING-GX and WING-CFS programs framed my research identity. I came to understand myself as an architect of socio-technical systems, not only as an engineer. The experience emphasized that resilience and efficiency are inseparable: energy-efficient designs are more resilient, and resilient systems must be efficient to survive in constrained environments.

---

It is also worth reflecting that our work was modest. A single floating island array will not decarbonize Tsushima. But as an educational project, it demonstrated pathways: combine biomass, solar, and digital monitoring into modular systems; embed them in policy structures; respect local traditions; and communicate across industry, academia, and government. This is the GX method in practice.

---

In parallel, the WING-CFS poster projects provided me with the opportunity to refine my communication style. Explaining to both technical and non-technical audiences forced clarity. Posters, presentations, and TV features were not simply outputs, but practice in cross-disciplinary translation. This too is part of GX: enabling society to understand and adopt the solutions we propose.

---

The programs continue to shape my work. Today, in my robotics research, I frame every algorithm not only in terms of accuracy or speed, but in terms of energy draw, efficiency, and resilience. This mindset was directly shaped by SPRING-GX and WING-CFS. They showed me that being an engineer today is inseparable from being a policy-aware, energy-aware, and resilience-aware system architect.
