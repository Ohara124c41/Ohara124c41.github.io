## About

This repository powers my GitHub Pages site.  
It is based on the Hux Blog Jekyll theme, but trimmed and customized for my own writing, projects, and systems work.

## Customization

Most of the site can be configured via `_config.yml`:

    # Site settings
    title: Ohara’s Atelier
    SEOTitle: Ohara’s Atelier
    description: "Systems, AI, and Design"

    # Build settings
    paginate: 10

Posts live in the `_posts/` folder as Markdown files with front-matter:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  "Example Post"
    subtitle: "Subtitle here"
